# PSEUDOCODING

# Driver code will handle input and output
# => explain the rules to the players
# => request names from players
# => address users by name
# => word should be able to communicate with ruby class
# => word will test what response, and add to the count of guesses
# => if guesses are up, taunting message, game over
# => if correct, congratulating message, game over
#
# One user enters a word
# => request user enter a word
# =>
#
# Another user guesses
# => address player two of word/length and guesses
#
# Guesses are limited
# Number of guesses related to length of word
# => one guess for each letter in word
# => use index and loop to count current guesses
# => conditional code to loop for guesses
#
#
# Like wheel-of-fortune, guesses will appear when correct
# => using array of answer and empty array, display current game before each turn
