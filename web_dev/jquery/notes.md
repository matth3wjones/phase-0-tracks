google and look for resources
look for video and audio formats if available
take regular breaks
test every half hour what i have learned

build library and call it j_one_s or j.one.s if possible

watching videos from a service such as Safari Books online works best for my learning style, allowing me to take notes, and hear the instructor's intended interpretations.
