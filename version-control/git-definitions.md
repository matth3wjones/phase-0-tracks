# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version Control is a system that manages changes to a given document, code or project, saving multiple versions.  It allows multiple versions of a project to coexist while they are in development.  Version Control is used in coding to ensure the master remains secure, and that updates and additions are safe before implementation to the master.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of your code that allows one to work on your code without affecting the master.  Using a branch is a smart and safer way to work on your code as it does not affect the master until they are merged.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a way of making a set of changes permanent.  Good commit message is detailed and identifies the changes made since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when the two versions of code are not compatible with one another.
